# Pyramid.c
  In this program:
- The `printNumberPyramid` function takes the number of rows as a parameter and prints the pyramid pattern with numbers.
- It uses nested `for` loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the pattern.
- The outer loop (`i`) iterates from 1 to the total number of rows.
- The first inner loop (`j`) is used to print the appropriate number of spaces before each row to create the pyramid shape.
- The second inner loop (`j`) is used to print the numbers. In each row, the numbers start from 1 and increment by 1 for each position in the row.
- After printing each row, a newline character (`\n`) is printed to move to the next line.
- In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter the number of rows for the number pyramid pattern using `printf` and `scanf`.
- The `printNumberPyramid` function is called with the provided number of rows to print the number pyramid pattern.
